<div class = "pic"><img src = "https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAIKAAAAJGM5MGFlZjc0LTJiMDgtNGRjYi1hMDdmLTUyOGFiODdhMDExZg.jpg"></div>
<h5> Premise </h5>
<p> Our world is overrun with information demanding our attention.
There is always buzz about new movies, tv shows, music and news that
is trending at any given point. You see these trending topics on
Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. Sure, you can track items by ratings, upvotes or shares
but that doesn't necessarily mean it will be interesting to you. But with so much, how 
do you know what topics will be most interesting to you? It is easy to lose the signal
in so much noise, which is where we come in. </p>
<h5> The Value Proposition </h5>
<h6> We save you time and money by using big data analytics to find the 
best entertainment and reading material for you. </h6> 
<p> Movies & TV - <strong>Over 350 movies and 250 new tv shows </strong> are released every year. 
How many do you see and of those, how many did you enjoy? What if we could 
predict what you will enjoy based on what have enjoyed? You can
go to the theatres and never leave disappointed. You can get specific 
recommendations so you won't have to dig through Netflix looking
for something good to watch. It will be good and if you follow our advice,
you'll never be disappointed again. </p>
<p> Music - <strong>Over 20,000 artists </strong>release new albums or singles each year. You know
which genres you like, but that is not enough to help you discover new artists or songs that you will like.
What if we could tell you which songs you will like before you hear them? Not only does this save you time
discovering new artists but also sorting through their music to find their best work. </p>
<p> News - <strong>Over ten million of news stories </strong> are released 
each year. Reading books and sorting through accurate news sources is extremely time consuming.
Oftentimes, different news sources have inaccurate or conflicting information, leaving
you more confused than before you read them. What if we could tell what you should read on what
you said you liked? Every news story will be relevant to you. Avoid
clickbate titles and actually extract meaningful information from each page you visit. </p>
<h5> How It Works </h5>
<p> For $5/mo, you can use our engine to find the best movies, tv, music, books and news stories. If you're
skeptical that we can deliver on these promises, try it free for one month. We don't just find the best in 
all these categories for the average person, we find the best for <i>you</i>. When you register, you select
a few things that you like. Our sample user has selected: "Birdman" for movies, "Breaking Bad" for TV, "Glitch
Mob" for music and "Thomas Friedman" for news/current events. Based on those selections, we curate recommendations
which we know our customers will love. Scroll through the carousel to see some sample recommendations and click on the image links to find the content*. What sets us apart is <b>
how</b> we do this. We don't just use your past TV history to predict your future TV history. We take the news you read, movies & TV you watch and music you listen to in order to gauge your personality. Utilizing all four of these things in our predictions helps us do better.</p>
